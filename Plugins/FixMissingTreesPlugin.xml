  <Description>
	  This plugin fixes the client-side issue in https://support.keenswh.com/spaceengineers/pc/topic/44535-client-side-environment-item-e-g-tree-lod-issue
	  
	  This was caused by the function populating environment items incorrectly removing the number of items that had already been spawned
	  from the number of items considered for the target LOD.
	  
	  i.e. if there were 39 items spawned and the target LOD should consider 107 items, it was only considering 68 items
