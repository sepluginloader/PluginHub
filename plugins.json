When testing with a Wooting Two (the one with Flaretech switches), binding any movement action to the arrow keys would look right in the settings menu but it would be bound to the numpad in game. It will hopefully be fixed in a future version of the Wooting SDK.\n\nThere is also an issue with wheels and analog controls.

An auto-incrementing hexadecimal auto-ID string is appended to uniquely identify each GPS.\n/gpsx_reset resets the auto-incrementing auto-ID. Does not modify existing GPS.\n/gps_export [string] export all matching GPS to clipboard. No argument exports all GPS.\n/gps_toggle [string] toggle visibility of all matching GPS. No argument toggles all GPS.\n/gps_off [string] turn visibility of matching GPS off. No argument toggles all GPS.\n/gps_on [string] turn visibility of matching GPS on.

So, on half of the planets/moons, and all of space in this game there is no reason to simulate that which would not exist.\nThe lines in the light cast have been removed, because experiments with light show that they would not be visible beyond a few feet in front of the spotlight. In order for a shadow to be cast by objects in front of the light, much more of the light must be obscured. The glass guard that is supposed to create the lines doesn't block the central point of the light source in any significant way, and is therefore invisible at a distance from the spotlight itself.\n  "

I introduce to you the Projector Highlighter!\n\nProjected blocks that can be built have a green wireframe around their block space, while incorrect blocks will have a red outline (without \"Show Only Buildable\" selected), both of which are visible through other blocks.\n\nYellow blocks are damaged or incomplete blocks connected to parts of the projection.\n\nFor simplicity, this runs only on clients and they bear the brunt of a slightly inefficient grid check. Only grids within 250m are checked every minute to see if they have any projectors.\n\nCycle the highlights by entering /highlight in chat\n\nExpect it to take up to a minute when placing a new projector to see any effect.\nOnce it's picked up on a projector updates occur every second."
